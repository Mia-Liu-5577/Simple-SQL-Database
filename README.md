- Developed a relational database system in C++, incorporating fundamental functionalities like query parsing, compilation, optimization, and execution.
- Constructed a SQL frontend employing semantic checking with Flex and Bison, alongside a backend capable of executing selection, projection, join, aggregate, and grouping operations.
- Enhanced query execution efficiency through the implementation of multi-threading for relational operations
